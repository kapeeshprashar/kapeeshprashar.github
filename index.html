                            <p> It's Not Really All Her Fault, She's Just A Little Slow, Has Severe Mental Illnesses And Was Duped By Her Mother And Some Pricks Who Obviously Aren't Her Friends, (Not To Say She Isn't Guilty, She Did Commit All Those Crimes, And Could've Avoided The Situation If She Wasn't Led By Her Mother, Greed, Insecurity, Astounding Stupidity, Cowardice, Inner Prostitute & Fear) What's Concerning Is That I'm Still Not Sure If She's Aware That Her FrIeNdS Have Successfully Set Her Up. If You're Just Interested In That Situation And How I Made It Out Of Their Nonsense Through Nothing But Fair Means, Skip To 15:30. By The End Of It You'll Learn Why I've Chosen To Forgive These Irredeemable Scum. Although I Will Mess With Everyone In Just Ways That Got Involved That Doesn't Directly Know Me, Including The Corrupt Officials They Involved Because Fuck Them And Examples Have To Be Made For The Greater Good, I'll Go Easy On Them But I've Been Damned Patient, The Longer They Wait To "Fix" This, The Longer They Evade, The More They Plot, The More They Scheme, They're Just Gonna Make It Worse For Themselves. One Of The Reasons I Waited So Long To Drop The Curtains Is To Demonstrate To Everyone & Themselves, To Make Sure It Is Known To Be Objective That Their Blood Is Incapable Of Remorse, Regret Sure, Remorse No... In The Sense That They're All So Petty, Scummy, Pathetic & Money Hungry That This Would've Continued Had I Not Intervened The Way I Did. Also All Of Them Drive Like Danica Patrick, I Have To Be Wildly Drunk To Match Their Sober Driving Skills (idk why but I know it was wildly important to add that).</p>
                            
                            <p>Justice Will Be Served, Let's See Who Has Enough Of A Conscience To Go With The Flow & Not Against It // Let's See Who Knows What Principle Is, Let's See Who Has The Courage To Speak Up Before Nearing The End, And Let's See What Direction The Mothers Encourage The Succubi They Raised To Go.</p>
