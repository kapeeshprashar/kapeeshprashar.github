                            <p> It's Not Really All Arushi's Fault, She's Just A Little Slow, Has Severe Mental Illnesses And Was Duped By Her Mother And Some Pricks Who Obviously Aren't Her Friends, (Not To Say She Isn't Guilty, She Did Commit All Those Crimes, And Could've Avoided The Situation If She Wasn't Led By Her Mother, Greed, Insecurity, Astounding Stupidity, Cowardice, & Fear) What's Concerning Is That I'm Still Not Sure If She's Aware That Her FrIeNdS Have Successfully Set Her Up. If You're Just Interested In That Situation And How I Made It Out Of Their Nonsense Through Nothing But Fair Means, Skip To 15:30. By The End Of It You'll Learn Why I've Chosen To Forgive These Irredeemable Scum. Although I Will Mess With Everyone In Just Ways That Got Involved That Doesn't Directly Know Me, Including The Corrupt Officials They Involved Because Fuck Them And Examples Have To Be Made For The Greater Good, I'll Go Easy On Them But I've Been Damned Patient, The Longer They Wait To "Fix" This, The Longer They Evade, The More They Plot, The More They Scheme, They're Just Gonna Make It Worse For Themselves. One Of The Reasons I Waited So Long To Drop The Curtains Is To Demonstrate To Everyone & Themselves, To Make Sure It Is Known To Be Objective For All Of Time That Their Blood Is Incapable Of Remorse, Regret Sure, Remorse No... In The Sense That They're All So Petty, Scummy, Pathetic & Money Hungry That This Would've Continued Had I Not Intervened The Way I Did.</p>

                            <p> you are doing this to yourself, I only put something up on this site whenever you literal prostitute losers do something malicious and unprovoked towards me. I have no Shame because I'm right, you have no Shame because you're in denial. I don't get it, you always wait for like a day after I remove the last update on the site to do something? you needlessly made an enemy out of me and now you objectively inferior things with orifices are mad because you proved Siddharth right on your own initiative? Bro I'm doing what I've been trying to do this entire time, stay in my lane and get on with it, if you still have a problem with that then idk y'all clearly need help... kari jao, but if I'm gonna stop retaliating then I'm going out with a bang, not a whimper. Might as well leave with a few messages that'll leave you with an impact. You want answers as to what happens next? keep reading.</p>
                            
                            <p>You know how your parents in particular say "Teri beti - Teri beti" to each other when talking about you? It's because you've worn out your orifices too much, you're no longer of use to them until they can sell you off as a bride for a lumpsum. The truth of what you did will out, it will haunt you for a bit but you don't have a conscience so you'll probably just forgive yourself and move on, you're not gonna be an architect and you know that, do you know why? because you're autisticly fucking horrible at it, remember your internship? Yeah idk what lies you told your parents but you were noticeably shit at your job, felt pretty dumb there didn't you? Seeing the path you chose, my money's on a corporate slave, I'm gonna say a schizophrenic lawyer that would free rapists for a midsize cheque, he'll be attractive... for the first few years, he'll be nice to  you... for the first few months, but he will eventually realise that he owns you and there's nothing your can do about it. Now here's where it gets fun, both of you are going to cheat on each other DAMNED SOON, I won't say who does it first, makes things more entertaining for me, he will at some point in your relationship, fairly early on, beat the living fuck out of you while he fucks one of your friends and tells her how much better she is than you, this will be the norm in your life for several years. Not unlike your father he's gonna have a small dick and occasional ED but you'll stick with him knowing y'all are gonna fuck other people and you can use the man for money, he's not gonna age well and he'll probably keep his hair but will only be able to grow a womans beard, you're going to have an abortion within the next few years and you're going to die young, you already know of what, maybe even younger than me, but I'm not sure about that just yet.</p>

                            <p>In relation to your brother he'll be alright with his work, but his marriage is gonna be hell till the very end, idc what claims he makes, he's gonna get married, bhenchod ki Maa kraake rahegi, but the woman you guys invite into your lives is going to be identical to how Arushi was in this ordeal with me, except you dumbfucks are gonna be too slow to realise it. Call it fate, call it karma.</p>

                            <p>your dad is going to die cold, alone, suddenly and a lot sooner than you think of natural causes, I will be on his mind in the moments preceding death. How's his sugar intake? How's his heart? Not even his family will remember him beyond 3 months after he's gone... but usko pata hai.</p>
                        
                            <p> No spoilers for your mother, Imma keep that to myself.</p>
                        
                            <p>Take 30 seconds to ask yourself if this is fair game, if it is... then it is, if it isn't... then take me to Court</p>
                            
                            <p>Hopefully I won't have to say it again... Fuck off ya taints. The website gets reset within the week, hopefully I won't have to do this again.</p>
