                            <p>Note: $200... Really? Here's Something I Forgot To Add Earlier, When You Commit Credit Card Fraud You're Not Stealing From The Cardholder, You're Stealing From The Bank GeNiUsEs. It Took Exactly 12 Minutes To Get The Amount Back, The Bank Deals With You... Not Me. This Is Funny Enough For Another Edit Because After I So Explicitly Pointed Out Everywhere You Messed Up, You Figure The Smartest Thing To Do Is Start A Corporate Investigation On Yourself, Wow That's Kind Of Dumb... Why Do You Think It's Called A CREDIT Card Dimwits... You Don't Need To Take Commerce To Know Basic Economics... Or Maye YOU Do. Doxxed Cards Bathere Nikaale Hai Life Me, Imagine Being A Black Hat Hacker... Criiinnngggeeeeeeee. Imagine Being So Uneducated That You Have To Steal. Looks Like You've Run Out Of Luck. Sighhhh I'm Counting What You Just Did As Harassing My Mother Again Soooooooo... Whatever Follows Is On You, I'm Not Even Gonna Get My Hands Dirty. Don't Act Like I Never Told Ya.</p>
                            
                            <p> It's Not Really All Her Fault, She's Just A Little Slow, Has Severe Mental Illnesses And Was Duped By Her Mother And Some Pricks Who Obviously Aren't Her Friends, (Not To Say She Isn't Guilty, She Did Commit All Those Crimes, And Could've Avoided The Situation If She Wasn't Led By Greed & Fear) What's Concerning Is That I'm Still Not Sure If She's Aware That Her FrIeNdS Are Setting Her Up. If You're Just Interested In That Situation And How I Made It Out Of Their Nonsense Through Nothing But Fair Means, Skip To 15:30. Immediately Before This There Was A More blunt Flow Of Information On This Website Which I Have Stored (Including The Individual Hits The Website Got At Specific Times/From Specific Regions. What's Funny Is That Some Criminals Are Too Cheap To Dish Out For A Good VPN, The Ones They Use Are So Shit That Even Cloudflare Can See Through It). By The End Of It You'll Learn Why I've Chosen To Forgive These Irredeemable Scum.</p>
