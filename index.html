If You're Just Interested In That Situation And How I Made It Out Of Their Nonsense Through Nothing But Fair Means, Skip To 15:30. By The End Of It You'll Learn Why I've Chosen To Forgive These Irredeemable Scum. Although I Will Mess With Everyone In Just Ways That Got Involved That Doesn't Directly Know Me, Including The Corrupt Officials They Involved Because Fuck Them And Examples Have To Be Made For The Greater Good, I'll Go Easy On Them But I've Been Damned Patient, The Longer They Wait To "Fix" This, The Longer They Evade, The More They Plot, The More They Scheme, They're Just Gonna Make It Worse For Themselves. One Of The Reasons I Waited So Long To Drop The Curtains Is To Demonstrate To Everyone & Themselves, To Make Sure It Is Known To Be Objective For All Of Time That Their Blood Is Incapable Of Remorse, Regret Sure, Remorse No... In The Sense That They're All So Petty, Scummy, Pathetic & Money Hungry That This Would've Continued Had I Not Intervened The Way I Did.</p>

(jokeeesssss/maybe not/it's your life, I'm not saying you SHOULD do it, but if you did I totally understand)</p>
                            
                            <p>to the wanna be bhad bhabie's and lil pumps that think they stand a chance. 
                                Everybody say the shit that you make is dumb,
I remember I was 18,
Money, pussy, parties, I was on the same thing,
You gotta give a boy a chance to grow some,
Everybody talkin' like they know somethin' these days,
Niggas actin' woke, but they broke umm,
I respect the struggle but you all frontin' these days,
Man, they barely old enough to drive,
To tell them what they should do, who the fuck am I?
I heard one of em' diss me, I'm suprised,
I ain't trippin', listen good to my reply,
                                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ii6u1wSAu90">I'm hoping for your sake that you ain't dumb as you look</a>,
But if it's really true what people sayin'
And you call yourself playin' with my name,
Then I really know you fucked, trust
I'll be around forever 'cause my skills is tip-top,
To any amateur niggas that wanna get rocked,
Just remember what I told you when your shit flop,
In five years you gon' be on Love & Hip-Hop, Bitch</p>
